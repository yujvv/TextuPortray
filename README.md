# TextuPortray

TextuPortray is an innovative Multi-Agent Time Series Generation system for portrait animation synthesis. It leverages the power of natural language processing and computer vision to generate dynamic facial expression sequences from a single input image and a textual description.


## 🚀 Coming Soon!

We're excited to announce that the code for TextuPortray will be open-sourced in the near future. Stay tuned for updates!

## 🌟 Features

- **Text-Driven Animation**: Generate expressive facial animations from natural language descriptions.
- **Single Image Input**: Create dynamic sequences from just one portrait image.
- **Multi-Agent System**: Utilize a sophisticated multi-agent approach for nuanced and coherent animations.
- **Cost-Effective**: Eliminate training costs required by traditional animation synthesis methods.
- **Fine-Grained Control**: Enhance controllability of natural and subtle expressions through text prompts.
- **Temporal Consistency**: Employ a communication protocol among agents to ensure smooth sequences.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **CoT Prompting and Reflection**: Refine user inputs for optimal processing.
2. **Multi-Agent Group**: Generate multidimensional expression parameters for keyframes.
3. **Multi-Mode Interpolation Engine**: Create smooth transitions between keyframes.
4. **Portrait Animation Synthesis**: Leverage pre-trained models to produce the final animated video.

## 📊 Results

Our experiments demonstrate TextuPortray's ability to generate high-quality, prompt-adherent animations with precise microexpressions and natural transitions.
